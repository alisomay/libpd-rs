//! # A safe wrapper around libpd
//!
//! [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) (Pd) is a visual programming language developed by
//! [Miller Puckette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Puckette) in the 1990s
//! for creating interactive computer music and multimedia works.
//! While Puckette is the main author of the program,
//! Pd is an [open-source project](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data) with a
//! [large developer base](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/graphs/contributors) working on new extensions.
//! It is released under [BSD-3-Clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
//!
//! Though pd is designed as a desktop application,
//! [libpd](https://github.com/libpd) is an open source project
//! which exposes it as a C library opening the possibility to
//! embed the functionality of pd to any platform which C can compile to.
//!
//! [libpd-rs](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs) aims to bring [libpd](https://github.com/libpd)
//! to the Rust [ecosystem](https://crates.io/).
//! It aims to expose the full functionality of [libpd](https://github.com/libpd)
//! with some extra additions such as bundling commonly used externals
//! and addition of extra functionality for increased ease of use.
//!
//! It is thoroughly [documented](https://docs.rs/libpd-rs/0.1.9/libpd_rs/#),
//! well [tested](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/tests) and enriched with
//! various [examples](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/examples) to get you started right away.
//!
//! Now let's make some sound! 🔔
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! Add the latest version of [libpd-rs](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs) to your `Cargo.toml`:
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! libpd-rs = "0.1.9"
//! cpal = "0.13"
//! ```
//! We also add [cpal](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal) to our dependencies
//! to get access to the high priority audio callback from the OS.
//!
//! [cpal](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal) is not a must.
//! You may have used any method to get audio callback from the OS.
//!
//! ## Examples and Usage
//!
//! To start making sound with [libpd-rs](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs), we need to have a pd patch at hand.
//! Pd patches are `.pd` files which could be read by pd desktop [application](https://puredata.info/downloads).
//!
//! Pd patches are not binary files, they are simple files full of pd commands as text.
//! [libpd-rs](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs) provides an additional way to
//! [evaluate](crate::convenience::PdGlobal::eval_patch) strings as pd patches.
//!
//! This is the [method](crate::convenience::PdGlobal::eval_patch) we'll use in the following examples.
//!
//! ### Initialize, open patch, run
//!
//! Paste the code into your `main.rs`:
//!
//! ⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️: This example will produce audio, so please keep your volume at a reasonable level for safety.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cpal::traits::{DeviceTrait, HostTrait, StreamTrait};
//! use libpd_rs::convenience::{PdGlobal, calculate_ticks};
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!
//!     // Initialize cpal
//!     // This could have been another cross platform audio library
//!     // basically anything which gets you the audio callback of the os.
//!     let host = cpal::default_host();
//!
//!     // Currently we're only going to output to the default device
//!     let device = host.default_output_device().unwrap();
//!
//!     // Using the default config
//!     let config = device.default_output_config()?;
//!
//!     // Let's get the default configuration from the audio driver.
//!     let sample_rate = config.sample_rate().0 as i32;
//!     let output_channels = config.channels() as i32;
//!
//!     // Initialize libpd with that configuration,
//!     // with no input channels since we're not going to use them.
//!     let mut pd = PdGlobal::init_and_configure(0, output_channels, sample_rate)?;
//!
//!     // Let's evaluate a pd patch.
//!     // We could have opened a `.pd` file also.
//!     // This patch would play a sine wave at 440hz.
//!     pd.eval_patch(
//!         r#"
//!     #N canvas 577 549 158 168 12;

//!         "#,
//!     )?;
//!
//!     // Build the audio stream.
//!     let output_stream = device.build_output_stream(
//!         &config.into(),
//!         move |data: &mut [f32], _: &cpal::OutputCallbackInfo| {
//!             // Provide the ticks to advance per iteration for the internal scheduler.
//!             let ticks = calculate_ticks(output_channels, data.len() as i32);
//!
//!             // Here if we had an input buffer
//!             // we could have modified it to do pre-processing.
//!
//!             // Process audio, advance internal scheduler.
//!             libpd_rs::process::process_float(ticks, &[], data);
//!
//!             // Here we could have done post processing
//!             // after pd processed our output buffer in place.
//!         },
//!         |err| eprintln!("an error occurred on stream: {}", err),
//!         None,
//!     )?;
//!
//!     // Turn audio processing on
//!     pd.activate_audio(true)?;
//!
//!     // Run the stream
//!     output_stream.play()?;
//!
//!     // Wait a bit for listening..
//!     std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5));
//!
//!     // Turn audio processing off
//!     pd.activate_audio(false)?;
//!
//!     // Pause the stream
//!     output_stream.pause()?;
//!
//!     // Close the patch
//!     pd.close_patch()?;
//!
//!     // Leave
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The patch you have just evaluated and listened looks exactly like this in pd desktop [application](https://puredata.info/downloads).
//!
//! ![Sine wave generating pd patch][sine_patch]
//!
//! ### Communicate with the patch
//!
//! Again with a simplistic patch, this time we'll send and receive messages from pd.
//! We'll be monitoring our cpu load average over a minute and 5 minutes, send this data to pd
//! as a list and let it change some parameters in our simplistic patch.
//!
//! As a last thing we'll send the data we've applied to an object in the patch  back to Rust to read it.
//! This is a very simple example of how to send and receive data.
//!
//! Add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! libpd-rs = "0.1.9"
//! cpal = "0.13"
//! sys-info = "0.9.1"
//! ```
//! Paste the code into your `main.rs`:
//!
//! ⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️: This example will produce audio, so please keep your volume at a reasonable level for safety.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cpal::traits::{DeviceTrait, HostTrait, StreamTrait};
//! use libpd_rs::{
//!     convenience::{PdGlobal, calculate_ticks}, receive::on_float, receive::receive_messages_from_pd, send::send_list_to,
//! };
//! use sys_info::loadavg;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     // Initialize cpal
//!     // This could have been another cross platform audio library
//!     // basically anything which gets you the audio callback of the os.
//!     let host = cpal::default_host();
//!

//!
//! The one minute average load is controlling the center frequency of the `vcf~` and the speed of the pulses.

//! The result is a pulse which goes higher in pitch and speed when the load is higher and vice versa.

//! Though not very interesting musically, hope it triggers your curiosity and imagination.

//! ### Note about examples
//!
//! After these basic initial examples which were aimed to get you started, you may dive into the
//! individual [modules](https://docs.rs/libpd-rs/0.1.9/libpd_rs/#modules)
//! and [items](https://docs.rs/libpd-rs/0.1.9/libpd_rs/all.html) in the documentation.
//! They all have their own examples.
//!
//! You may discover [integration tests](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/tests)
//! and explore [examples](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/examples)
//! in the [repository](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs).
//!
//! The [examples](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/examples)
//! directory in the [repository](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs) is not filled with
//! all the examples imagined yet.
//!
//! On the other hand it'll be updated with variety of
//! [new examples](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/issues/8) very soon.
//!
//! Enjoy!
//!
//! ## Things to note
//!
//! [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) is a C library and the implementation allocates libpd **globally**.
//! This means that you can only have one instance of libpd running at a time.
//! There is support for [multi instances](https://github.com/libpd/libpd/blob/master/libpd_wrapper/z_libpd.h#L529)
//! in [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) but those
//! will be implemented in [libpd-rs](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs) in the future.
//!
//! This is not very Rust like and on top of that we do not manage the memory of that instantiation.
//! Using it from different threads is fine because [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) has
//! locking implemented inside it.
//!
//! On the other hand, the programming style and state tracking might be a little different that how we do it in Rust.
//!
//! There are many functions and less data structures in this crate.
//! Because all, of those functions act as methods for a globally
//! initialized singleton libpd instance.
//!
//! There are limited ways of retrieving state from the running libpd instance but libpd-rs provides
//! [`PdGlobal`](crate::convenience::PdGlobal) to track some of the
//! state manually on the other hand this operation needs to be handled with care.
//! See [`PdGlobal`](crate::convenience::PdGlobal) for more details.
//!
//! ## Plans and Support
//!
//! Please see [libpd-rs](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs) [support](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs#support) and
//! [road map](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs#road-map) section for more details on these topics.
//!
//! Also don't forget to check [issues](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs/issues), to track the ideas and plans.
//!
//! ## Last words
//!
//! Generative or algorithmic music is a powerful tool for exploration,
//! pumps up creativity and goes very well together with traditional music making approaches also.
//!
//! Making apps which produce meaningful sound is difficult,
//! I wish that this crate would ease your way on doing that and make complicated audio ideas
//! in apps accessible to more people.
//!
//! Don't forget to check the [resources](https://github.com/alisomay/libpd-rs#resources)
//! section to expand your knowledge about pure data.
//!
//! Many thanks to [Başak Ünal](https://basakunal.design) for the logo.
//!
//! Happy patching!

///
/// [`libpd`](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) internally initializes pd and provides a way to communicate with it but it does it in global scope.
/// On the Rust side we do not have access to that piece of memory and we need to use what we have from exposed APIs.
///
/// [`libpd`](https://github.com/libpd/libpd) does not provide a very detailed way to track the state of pd yet. We need our own state tracking to track which
/// senders we have subscribed, which paths we have registered to the list of pd search paths or if the dsp is running or not.
///
/// This module provides some types for this and some wrapper functions for easier communication with pd.
///
/// There is one thing to note though. The state tracked in the Rust side is **decoupled** from libpd's internal state.
