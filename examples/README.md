# Examples

I believe that the best way to explore a crate is to read or try examples.

This section will contain more and more meaningful examples with variety in time.

⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️: All examples produce audio. Please make sure that your device's volume is at a reasonable level before running these programs.

## `simple`

This one is the exact same program which is provided in the main `README.md` file.

```sh
cargo run --example simple
```

## `communicate`

This one is the exact same program which is provided in the docs as the second example.

```sh
cargo run --example communicate
```

## `with_nannou`

[nannou](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou) is a fantastic creative coding framework for Rust.

Coupling it with pure data makes it a great tool for audio visual programming.

Here is an example to mess around:

```sh
cargo run --example with_nannou
```

Please also check the [tests](/tests/) folder if you'd like to explore example like code.
